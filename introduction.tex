Welcome to SUBC! Whether you're in first or eighth year, we hope that this guide helps you navigate the world of electronics development for human-powered submarines. This guide is intended to be first an overview of some things that you should know, and second a reference material for when you just \emph{know} something, but it's evading you on the tip of your tongue.
