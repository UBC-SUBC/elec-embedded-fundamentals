\chapter{Introduction}
Welcome to SUBC! Whether you're in first or eighth year, we hope that this guide helps you navigate the world of electronics development for human-powered submarines. This guide is intended to be first an overview of some things that you should know, and second a reference material for when you just \emph{know} something, but it's evading you on the tip of your tongue.

As a primary onboarding measure, we intend to produce videos and run workshops covering much of the same content as is covered in this guide.

\section{Safety Note}
Please make sure to follow all safety guidelines outlined in this guide and given by the team, workspace, or university. In general, here is a by-no-means comprehensive set of rules of thumb to follow:
\begin{itemize}
	\item High voltages are often dangerous.
	\item Anything with sharp or hot things should only be done with safety glasses.
	\item If you don't know how to do, or have never done, something, ask for help before doing it.
	\item Don't download anything from the internet that seems suspicious.
\end{itemize}
\emph{Remember, your safety is the number-one priority. A safe team is a happy and productive team.}
